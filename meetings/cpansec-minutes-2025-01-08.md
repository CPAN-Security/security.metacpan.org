### TLS/HTTPS/CSPRNG/DSA in core
- @leont - Worked on BearSSL & OpenSSL
  - cleaning up Crypt::OpenSSL/Net::SSLeay (and to a lesser extent, IO::Socket::TCP/IO::Socket::SSL) is required but tedious.
- @sjn - is funding wanted/useful?

### Funding drive
- [German Sovereign Tech fund](https://www.sovereign.tech/programs/fund)
- [GitHub Secure Open Source Fund](https://resources.github.com/github-secure-open-source-fund/) deadline Jan 7th
- Alpha-Omega
- @sjn will work on that after FOSDEM - will need to know who is open to do (funded) work
    - @stigtsp 1d/w

### Ongoing vulnerabilities
- @robrwo - POSIX::2008 CVE-2024-55564 already added for &lt; v0.24, not for &lt; v0.04
    - @robrwo - Net::OAuth released with fix, CVE-2025-22376
    - WWW::OAuth released with fix based on fix to Net::OAuth, CVE request by @robrwo
    - Several modules waiting for ack from authors or 20/30 Jan to req CVEs and disclosure
- @tux - SQLite CVE was closed in [CPANSA DB](https://metacpan.org/release/BDFOY/CPANSA-DB-20250104.001/source/Changes#L7)

### Author guide to generating random values for security
- @robrwo - Guide is published
   - Link posted on security.metacpan.org front page
   - No feedback received
   - Crypt::URandom (the main module recommended) still has issues to be worked on.
   - Maybe promote it on blogs.perl.org by late Jan
   - PR for Perl to change docs for recommended modules
- @stigtsp - summarizing this work is useful/positive

### CPAN Author's Security Policy Guidelines

  - Out of draft
  - @robrwo posted about it on blogs.perl.org. That post, and a link to original guidelines posted by briandfoy on Reddit.

  - [Issue raised in MetaCPAN](https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-web/issues/3246) to highlight the document like it does README, LICENSE etc
  - Most important: we are getting feedback
- @tux - Software::Security::Policy::Individual - do we need ::Team (or other name)?
  - team policies to be documented: active teams, active groups, active Github projects with more maintainers but no single person to address for vulnerabilities (hidden Github security issues)
  - discussed also different ideas about how templates will evolve.

### CPAN Meta Spec, Requirements and PURLs
