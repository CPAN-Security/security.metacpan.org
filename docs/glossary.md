> We recommend using the term Artifact specifically when referring to files (as defined), and Component in other situations. (CPANSec)

> 1. (SLSA-2023) An immutable blob of data; primarily refers to [software](#software), but SLSA can be used for any artifact.
>     * E.g. a file, a git commit, a directory of files (serialized in some way), a container image, a firmware image.
>
> See also: [Component](#component).
>
> (Ref: [SLSA-2023](#references-and-terms), CPANSec-2024)


### Author

> 1. (NTIA-2021) An entity that creates an SBOM.
>     * [author](#author) and [supplier](#supplier) will often be different. In the case of SBOMs, the author creates the SBOM. The supplier is the provider of the software included in the SBOM.
> 1. (CPANSec-2024) A developer that publishes something as Open Source software.
>
> See also: [Author](supplychain-sbom#author) in the Supply-chain SBOM Roles document.
>
> (Ref: [NTIA-2021](#references-and-terms), CPANSec-2024)


### Attestation

> 1. An authenticated statement (metadata) about a software artifact or collection of software artifacts.
>     * E.g. a signed SLSA Provenance file.
>
> (Ref: [SLSA-2023](#references-and-terms))


### Build

> 1. (SLSA-2023) Process that transforms a set of input artifacts into a set of output artifacts.
>     * The inputs may be sources, dependencies, or ephemeral build outputs.

>     * The NTIA-2021 definition below is therefore not only **wrong**, but also **entirely insufficient** — is for any practical purpose useless and should not be used.
>     * The SLSA-2023 definition below is preferred, though it doesn't sufficiently distinguish between stated, included and assumed dependencies.
>     * Please consider using the CPANSec-2024 definition

> 1. (CPANSec-2024) A dependency is a _resolved_ Requirement.
>     * This means the component that is depended upon (required) has been made available for use by the depending software so it may function as expected.
>     * Dependencies exist _after_ they have been made available to the depending software.
>     * If a dependency is unmet (not made available, deployed, installed), then it is called a _Requirement_.
>     * A dependency can come in many forms,
>         * Static, Dynamic, Resource or Service
>         * Included (Embedded), Direct or Transitive
>         * Assumed (Phantom) or Unused (Zombie)
