The CPAN Security Group was [authorized by the CVE Program](https://www.cve.org/Media/News/item/news/2025/02/25/CPAN-Security-Group-Added-as-CNA) as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) on Feb 25, 2025. A CNA assigns and manages CVE identifiers for projects in their scope.

Our scope is vulnerabilities in Perl and CPAN Modules (including End-of-Life Perl versions) found at [perl.org](https://perl.org/), [cpan.org](https://cpan.org/) or [metacpan.org](https://metacpan.org/), excluding distributions of Perl or CPAN Modules maintained by third-party redistributors.

CVE is an international, community-based effort to identify, define and catalog publicly disclosed software vulnerabilities. To learn more about the CVE program, visit [www.cve.org](https://www.cve.org).

## Report Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities should be reported according to the security policy of the affected project.
