    *   @sjn – Clarity around tasks and mandate. @sjn proposes a discussion on this at PTS


### Ongoing and updated vulnerabilities

*   CVE-2013-4407 - https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4407
    *   HTTP::Body::Multipart in the HTTP-Body 1.08, 1.17, and earlier module for Perl uses the part of the uploaded file's name after the first "." character as the suffix of a temporary file, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct attacks by leveraging subsequent behavior that may assume the suffix is well-formed.
    *   @stigtsp – This fix was thought to be real, but it wasn't. Some Linux distros (Debian, Gentoo) patched independently anyway, but many didn't. Version 1.23 has been fixed. Work ongoing for fixing confusion and communication breakdowns.
*   @timlegge working on blog post laying out this work and why we're doing it.
*   @stigtsp – Shared that he is looking into ongoing PAUSE issues, @andk intends to share info eventually.


### Operating changes

*   @sjn – Proposal: New project for ongoing CVE visibility work
    *   @timlegge - no problems with this
    *   @sjn - useful for visibility and budgeting and fund-raising
    *   Vote: Unanimously **in favor**.
*   @sjn – Proposal: New project for getting upstream to discover and accept security patches that already are being applied downstream.
    *   @stigtsp - This should include efforts on \_finding\_ patches downstream.
    *   @stigtsp - This project requires separate efforts on reporting/outreach and finding patches.
    *   @timlegge - Given we're all volunteers, this may be quite a bit of work.
    *   @sjn - this may be good for helping in recruitment too.
    *   Vote: Unanimously **in favor**.
*   @sjn – Proposal: Decide on Code of Conduct. Let's use the same as TPRF
    *   Vote: Unanimously **in favor**.
*   @stigtsp – Re-evaluating if CPANSec should be a CNA
    *   @timlegge - to find out what's involved
