## CVE Workflow

### 1. Report

Once an issue with a project is reported to CPANSec, via the cpan-security email list,
an initial ticket should be created in the
[CPANSec CNA issue tracker](https://github.com/CPAN-Security/cna-cve/issues),
and added in the "Reports" status of the [Vulnerability Tracking Project](https://github.com/orgs/CPAN-Security/projects/21/views/1).

The issue may initially be discussed and triaged on the cpan-security email list, copying the reporter and maintainers.

Issues that are initially reported in other forums (even closed CPANSec channels) should be forwarded to the cpan-security list.

### 2. Triage

When triage starts, the ticket should be moved into the "Triage" status.

Triage and coordination will be in the cpan-security list, although there may be some discussion on the CPANSec TRIAGE matrix channel.

1. Is the issue in scope of CPANSec or the Perl Security Team?

   Note that a vulnerability in a library that is used by CPAN modules or Perl tools may still be relevant.

   If not, should it be forwarded to another team?  Otherwise the the ticket can be marked as "Closed".

2. Is this a security vulnerability?

   If yes, it will go to the CNA.

   Otherwise reject it as a security issue and mark it as "Closed".
   (Note that a bug should be forwarded to the relevant team if they have not been notified.)

3. What are the risks of this vulnerability?

   Discussion on the TRIAGE matrix channel, but important details should be added as comments to the github issue.

4. What other projects are affected by this vulnerability?

   Discussion on the TRIAGE matrix channel, but important details should be added as comments to the github issue.

   - Forks

   - Downstream projects

   - Identify other projects with similar vulnerabilities.

     These may require new issues to be created.

5. What mitigations or solutions are available?

   Discussion on the TRIAGE matrix channel, but important details should be added as comments to the github issue.

### 3. CNA

Initially the ticket is moved to the "CNA CVE Draft" status.

1. Does this meet the preconditions of a CVE?  https://www.cve.org/resourcessupport/allresources/cnarules

   - Is this a duplicate?

   - Is this in scope of CPANSec CNA?

2. Reservation of CVE

   If the CNA decides this issue is in scope.

    (commit `reserved/CVE-1900-1234` straight to `main`)

3. Additional triage

   Discussion on the TRIAGE matrix channel, but important details should be added as comments to the ticket.

   Links to relevant references should be gathered:
   - Discussion of the issue on other ticketing systems
   - Links to source code repositories and patches
   - Links to relevant RFCs and other documentation
   - Links to upstream vulnerabilities (embedded libraries with flaws)

4. Coordinate with the reporter, and copy the maintainer(s) of the module if they are different.

   **TODO** improved/documented vulnerability disclosure process with times, phases and well-publicised steps.

   - Choose a disclosure date, if it has not already been disclosed. Generally it should be no longer than one month.

     There may not be a specific date, but coordinated with a new release that fixes the issue.

   - Consider whether to disclose to other affected parties, e.g. Linux distros, CPAN/MetaCPAN/PAUSE, Perl Security Team, downstream projects.

   -Feedback to the reporter and maintainters

    - Does the reporter want to be credited?

    - Are the maintainers aware of this issue? Do they agree that this is an issue?

    - Notify the reporter and maintainer of the CVE.

5. Creation of CVE YAML/JSON, announcement text and possible patch in PR for the CNA repository

   **TODO** PR and CVE style guide

   **TODO** discussion of the tools that we use.

   Move the ticket to "CVE Review and Hold" status.

6. If no release has been coordinated, then we should consider developing patches to publish along with the CVE.

### 4. Publication

1. Copy patch (if any) to security.metacpan.org and update CVE with link to patch.

   Share that link with any third parties that we have disclosed the vulnerability to.

   Note: this should be done when the publication of the CVE is imminent, as this counts as disclosure.

2. Merge CVE PR (`main` is supposed to reflect the public state)

3. Publish CVE to MITRE and add details to the PR.

4. Post announcement to cve-announce.

   - Post announcement to oss-security@lists.openwall.com for Perl, core modules, other widely used distributions or critical issues

   - Annnouncements on CPANSec Discussion matrix channel, and CPANSec social media (Mastodon, Bsky)

5. Submit patches to modules in PR if a fix has not yet been released.

Move the ticket state to "CVE Published".  Note that the actual ticket may be closed in GitHub issues, but this is separate from the "Closed" state in the project.

### 5. Followup

Move the ticket to "Followup" status.

1. Followup with downstream projects that are not part of coordinated disclosure.

2. Blog posts/articles about the issue on security.metacpan.org

   Add links from blogs.perl.org, www.perl.org, Reddit, Mastodon, other social media.

   This is optional, but recommended when the security issue is an example of a common pattern.

3. Evaluation of the workflow for this issue.

### 6. Closed

Move the ticket to the "Closed" status.
