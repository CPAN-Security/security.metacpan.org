## About this document

This text attempts to summarize the most important parts of the CRA, for Open Source ecosystems.

For license information and acknowledgements, see the [end of this document](#license-and-use-of-this-document).


### Purpose

Fostering the development of secure products

* _Harmonized standards_ create _presumption of conformance_.


#### Who does the CRA apply to? ([Recital (15)])

This Regulation applies to [economic operators](glossary.md#economic-operator) only in relation to products with digital elements [made available on the market](glossary.md#making-available-on-the-market) hence supplied for distribution or use on the Union market _in the course of a commercial activity_.

Supply _in the course of a commercial activity_ might be characterised […]

* by charging a price for a product with digital elements […]
* by charging a price for technical support services
  * where this does not serve only the recuperation of actual costs,
* by an intention to monetise,
  * for instance by providing a software platform through which the manufacturer monetises other services,
* by requiring as a condition for use the processing of personal data
  * for reasons other than exclusively for improving the security, compatibility or interoperability of the software, or
* by accepting donations
  * exceeding the costs associated with the design, development and provision of a product with digital elements.

Accepting donations without the intention of making a profit should not be considered to be a commercial activity


### Manufacturers

Manufacturers are obliged to _exercise due diligence when integrating components from third parties_, as laid out in [Article 13(5)]

* …after the Manufacturer conducts a risk assessment, as laid out in [Article 13(2)]
* …in accordance with essential requirements laid out in [Annex I, Part I]
  * The product is designed and developed in a way that ensures appropriate levels cybersecurity
  * …made available on the market without any known exploitable vulnerabilities
  * …made with a secure by default configuration
  * …made in such a way that security updates may be automatically applied within an appropriate time frame
  * …and more.

#### Manufacturers *must report on*…

* […] actively exploited vulnerabilities and severe incidents via an ENISA-run single reporting platform, as laid out in [Article 16]
* …in the way described in [Article 14(2)]
  * …submit an early warning if actively exploited vulnerabilities within 24 hours of discovery
  * …submit all relevant details about the nature of the exploit, without delay and within 72 hours
  * …submit a final report including available mitigations, within 14 days.

#### Manufacturers *are required to*… 

* report discovered vulnerabilities in components to their maintainers, and
  * share modifications developed to address the vulnerability with their maintainers, as laid out in [Article 13(6)]:

#### Manufacturers shall, *upon identifying a vulnerability in a component*…

[…] including in an open source-component, […]

* …in accordance with instructions laid out in [Annex I, part II]
  * …identify and document the vulnerability, including by drawing up an SBOM covering at minimum the top-level dependencies involved
  * …depending on risk posed, provide without delay a security update that addresses the vulnerability
  * …apply regular tests and reviews of the security of the product
  * …publicly share information about the vulnerability, it's impact and relevance, and how to remediate it
  * …publish and enforce a policy for coordinated vulnerability disclosure
  * …facilitate information sharing about vulnerabilities in the product and the components it uses
  * …provide mechanisms to securely distribute fixes in a timely manner
* …report the vulnerability to the person […] maintaining the component,
* …and address and remediate the vulnerability in accordance with the vulnerability handling requirements set out in [Annex I, part II].
* …and where manufacturers have developed a […] modification to address the vulnerability in that component,
  * they shall share the relevant code or documentation with the person […] maintaining the component, […].


Manufacturers are to draw up the EU declaration of conformity in accordance with [Article 28] and affix the CE marking in accordance with [Article 30] as laid out in [Article 13(12)]

* …to indicate conformity prior to entering the market ([Article 30(3)])
* …and keep records for ten years, as laid out in [Article 23(2)]

Manufacturers must provide a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) upon request by authorities, as laid out in [Recital (77)]
* …but no need for making these public.


#### Authorised representatives of Manufacturers  ⚠️  FIXME: Not done

> [!NOTE] See [Article 13], [Article 14], [Article 15], [Article 16], and [Article 17] for context.

Obligations for Authorised representatives of Manufacturers are laid out in [Article 18]

* …Testing necessary, provide technical documentation, as laid out in [Article 13(6)]
* …Vulnerability management
* …perform risk assessments
* …Coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) policy mandatory

* …offer support for their products for at least 5 years, security updates for 10 years


### Importers

#### Importers *shall only place on the market only products*…

…as laid out in [Article 19(1)]…

* …place on the market only products […] that
  * …comply with the essential requirements set out in [Annex I, Part I] and
     * …where the processes put in place by the manufacturer comply with the essential requirements set out in [Annex I, Part II]


### Distributors ⚠️  FIXME: Not done

When making a product with digital elements available on the market, distributors shall act with due care in relation to the requirements set out in this Regulation.

Before making a product with digital elements available on the market, distributors shall verify that:

* (a) the product with digital elements bears the CE marking;
* (b) the manufacturer and the importer have complied with the obligations set out in [Article 13(15)], [Article 16], [Article 18], [Article 19] and [Article 20] and have provided all necessary documents to the distributor.


### Open Source Software projects

* The mere circumstances under which the product […] has been developed, ([Recital (18)])
  * or how the development has been financed,
  * should […] not be taken into account when determining the commercial or non-commercial nature of that activity.
* […] the development of […] free and open-source software by *not-for-profit organisations* should ([Recital (18)])
  * not be considered to be a commercial activity
    * provided that the organisation is set up in such a way that ensures that all earnings after costs are used to achieve not-for-profit objectives.


### Maintainers

* CRA does not apply to you, as long as…
  * You are providing Free and Open Source Software (as mentioned in [Recital (18)])



#### Open Source software *intended for use in the course of a commercial activity* *is*…

([Recital (18)])

* Free and open-source software is understood as software the source code of which is openly shared
  * and the licensing of which provides for all rights to make it
    * freely accessible, usable, modifiable and redistributable.

* Free and open-source software is developed, maintained and distributed openly,
  * including via online platforms.

* In relation to economic operators that fall within the scope of this Regulation,
  * only free and open-source software made available on the market,
    * and therefore supplied for distribution or use _in the course of a commercial activity,_
  * should fall within the scope of this Regulation.

* The mere circumstances under which the product with digital elements has been developed,
  * or how the development has been financed,
    * should therefore not be taken into account when determining the commercial or non-commercial nature of that activity.
  * More specifically, for the purposes of this Regulation
    * and in relation to the economic operators that fall within its scope,
      * to ensure that there is a clear distinction between the development and supply phases,
    * the provision of products with digital elements qualifying as free and open-source software
      * that are not monetised by their manufacturers
    * should not be considered to be a commercial activity.

* Furthermore, **the supply of** products with digital elements
  * qualifying as **free and open-source software components**
    * **intended for integration by other manufacturers** into their own products with digital elements
  * **should be considered making available on the market**
    * **only if the component is monetised** by its original manufacturer.

* For instance,
  * the mere fact that an open-source software product with digital elements
    * receives financial support from manufacturers
    * or that manufacturers contribute to the development of such a product
  * should not in itself determine that the activity is of commercial nature.

* In addition,
  * the mere presence of regular releases
  * should not in itself lead to the conclusion that a product with digital elements
    * is supplied in the course of a commercial activity.

* Finally, for the purposes of this Regulation,
  * the **development of** products with digital elements
    * qualifying as **free and open-source software**
    * **by not-for-profit organisations**
    * **should not be considered to be a commercial activity**
      * **provided** that the organisation is set up in such a way
      * that ensures that **all earnings after costs are used to achieve not-for-profit objectives**.

* This Regulation does not apply to
  * natural or legal persons
    * who contribute with source code to products with digital elements
      * qualifying as free and open-source software
      * that are not under their responsibility.


### Open Source Stewards

#### OSS Stewards *are*…

* […] legal persons who *provide support on a sustained basis* for the development […] of products , and ([Article 3] (14))
  * who play a main role in **ensuring the viability** of those products […] ([Recital (19)])
  * [and…] only cover […] free and open-source software that are ultimately **intended for commercial activities**.

* The provision of **sustained support to the development of a product** […] **includes but is not limited to** the… ([Recital (19)])
  * hosting and managing of software development collaboration platforms,
  * hosting of source code or software,
  * governing or managing of products […] qualifying as free and open-source software, […or]
  * steering of the development of such products

* […] only subject to a "light-touch" and "tailor-made" regulatory regime, and ([Recital (19)])
  * are not to be permitted to affix the CE marking on products 


#### OSS Stewards *should*…

* […] subject to a light-touch and tailor-made regulatory regime ([Recital (19)])
  * […taking] account of their specific nature and compatibility with the type of obligations imposed
* […] only cover products […] qualifying as free and open-source software that are ultimately intended for commercial activities, such as
  * for integration into
    * commercial services, or
    * monetised products
* […] including cases where manufacturers that integrate a component into their own products […] either
  * contribute to the development of that component in a regular manner, or
  * provide regular financial assistance to ensure the continuity of a software product


#### OSS Stewards *include*…

* foundations […] ([Recital (19)])
* entities that develop and publish free and open-source software in a business context,
  * including not-for-profit entities.


#### OSS Stewards *are obliged to*…

(…as laid out in [Article 24])

* …facilitate the Manufacturer's _due diligence_ obligation set out in [Article 13(5)]
* …provide a cybersecurity policy for voluntary reporting of vulnerabilities, as laid out in [Article 15]
* …cooperate with market surveillance authorities and provide documentation. ([Article 24(2)])
* [Article 14(1)]
* …report on actively exploited vulnerabilities and severe incidents via an ENISA-run single reporting platform (as laid out in [Article 16], in the way described in [Article 14(1)], [Article 14(3)], and [Article 14(8)]).


#### OSS Stewards *attest*…

FOSS Software may get a voluntary security attestation, as described in [Article 25]

* …using an EU Attestation program as laid out in [Recital (21)]
  * …by requesting a certification from ENISA, as laid out in [Regulation (EU) 2019/881, Article 48](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881#page=8)
  * …in such a way that this security attestation can be initiated or financed by not only FOSS projects, but also by others, including manufacturers, users, or public administrations.
  * …so this Attestation becomes a "proof of due diligence exercised"? ⚠️  FIXME: (Dis)confirm this.
* …to facilitate Manufacturers' obligations to exercise due diligence when integrating components from third parties.


#### OSS Stewards *should expect that Market surveillance authorities*

* […] be responsible for carrying out market surveillance activities in relation to the obligations for open-source software stewards […]. [Article 52(3)]
* […] inform consumers of where to submit complaints that could indicate non-compliance with this Regulation […] and […] facilitate reporting of vulnerabilities, incidents and cyber threats […]. ([Article 52(11)])


#### OSS Stewards *should expect that the EU commission*

The Commission shall publish Guidance that shall address (…as laid out in [Article 26(2)])

* […] (a) the scope of this Regulation, with a particular focus on
  * remote data processing solutions and
  * free and open-source software
* […] (d) the concept of substantial modification

#### Open questions

* "Commission shall publish guidance to assist economic operators in applying this Regulation"
  * 
* Who gives out attestations?
  * Under what terms?
  * Can these attestations be used as a "value add" to existing components in such a way that may be sold by Stewards to fund it's work and it's community.
