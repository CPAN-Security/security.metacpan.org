# CPAN Security Working Group

This is an introduction!

Note:

Hei! I'm <NAME> and I'm here to introduce the CPAN Security Working Group to you


[comment]: # (!!!)

## CPAN-SEC

* Made @Â **Perl Toolchain Summit** 2023 in Lyon, France
* We care about **security on CPAN**!

Note:

Established in April this year at the Perl Toolchain Summit in Lyon, France



[comment]: # (!!!)

## What do we care about?

Note:

This is an introduction and a **call for participation**!

Here are some of the things we care about!


[comment]: # (|||)

### CPAN Vulnerability Index

ðŸ‘‰ **Audit** and track vulnerabilities

Note:

Improve security awareness by standardizing and publishing CPAN package vulnerabilities in relevant indices (our own, or CVE, or other). Possibly register as a CVE Numbering Authority.


[comment]: # (|||)

### CPAN Provenance & Supply Chain Security

ðŸ‘‰ Establish a **trusted publishing infrastructure**

Note:

Establish a trusted publishing infrastructure and tooling, with inspiration from `in-toto.io` and "Salsa" (`SLSA`). 


[comment]: # (|||)

### CPAN Software Bills of Materials

ðŸ‘‰ **SBOM** creation and verification

Note:

Support risk analysis and management by writing tooling for managing standard SBOM objects like OWASP CycloneDX or SPDX, and do this by using existing and new CPAN metadata.


[comment]: # (|||)

### CPAN Transparency Logs

ðŸ‘‰ Tooling for **third-party monitoring** of&nbsp;package&nbsp;changes

Note:

Write tooling for monitoring package updates and integrity checking of metadata using tools like `sigstore` or `sigsum`, or take inspiration from `transparency.dev`.


[comment]: # (|||)

### CPAN Security Patch Tooling

ðŸ‘‰ Tooling for CPAN Distro security patches to enable **high-priority updates**

Note:

Enable high-priority updates of CPAN packages, by developing tooling for publishing and applying third-party security patches to CPAN distributions with non-responsive authors.


[comment]: # (|||)

### CPAN Security Outreach & Information

ðŸ‘‰ Security and **incident communication** through relevant&nbsp;media&nbsp;channels

Note:

Keep different information channels (websites, social media) up-to-date and relevant with info on incidents, best practices and other documentation.


[comment]: # (|||)

### And more!

* ðŸ‘‰ Software Composition Analysis
* ðŸ‘‰ CPAN-SEC Governance, Policy & Funding
* ðŸ‘‰ Rich Metadata & Dependencies
* ðŸ‘‰ Privacy and Compliance

Note:

And more!

* Analyze dependencies for known vulnerabilities
* Establish constructive rules, playbooks, governance, policy, and funding channels
* Improve interoperability with non-CPAN package indices
* Track legal and privacy issues around CPAN metadata, and compliance with regulations


[comment]: # (!!!)

## Why now?

* **Increased demands from upcoming laws** on supply chain security and metadata
    * US [EO 14028](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/) _Improving the Nationâ€™s Cybersecurity_
    * EU [NIS2 Directive](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis2-directive) &amp; [Cyber Resilience Act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/cyber-resilience-act)
* **Raise community awareness** on security topics
* CPAN is in the dependency trees of _many_ businesses, so it's high time we **get our ducks in&nbsp;a&nbsp;row**&nbsp;ðŸ¦†ðŸ¦†ðŸ¦†ðŸ¦†

Note:

Why?
* Increased demand from upcoming laws

EU NIS2 Directive 2022/2555
* Applies to producers of software used by EU institutions that manage **critical infrastructure**
* To be implemented in local law by October 2024

EU Cyber Resilience Act
* CE certification of software used in and with **internet-connected devices**
* Expected to be implemented by July 2025

US Executive Order 14028
* "on Improving the Nationâ€™s Cybersecurity"
* For anyone working with or selling to the US federal government
* In effect as of May 2021

Also: Raise awareness on impact and responsibility around security on CPAN
