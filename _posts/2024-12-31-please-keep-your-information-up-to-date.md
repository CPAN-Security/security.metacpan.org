Some end of year reminders for CPAN Authors:

Do all of your modules have up-to-date contact information? If not, please release new versions with an updated email address in the AUTHOR section.

(And while you're at it, why not add a [security policy](https://security.metacpan.org/docs/guides/security-policy-for-authors.html) to your distribution, so that people know how and where to report a security issue with your module.)

If you have a cpan.org email alias, does it forward to the correct email address?
(You can [edit your email settings in PAUSE](https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=edit_cred).)

And most importantly, if you are taking time away from maintaining Perl modules, please add ADOPTME or NEEDHELP as co-maintainers to [mark your modules as available](https://neilb.org/2013/08/07/adoptme.html).

Thanks, and best wishes for 2025.
