## About this document

This text attempts to summarize the most important parts of the CRA, for Open Source ecosystems.

For license information and acknowledgements, see the [end of this document](#license-and-use-of-this-document).


### Purpose

Fostering the development of secure products

* _Harmonized standards_ create _presumption of conformance_.


### Manufacturers

Manufacturers are obliged to _exercise due diligence when integrating components from third parties_, as laid out in [Article 13(5)]

* …after the Manufacturer conducts a risk assessment, as laid out in [Article 13(2)]
* …in accordance with essential requirements laid out in [Annex I, Part I]
  * The product is designed and developed in a way that ensures appropriate levels cybersecurity
  * …made available on the market without any known exploitable vulnerabilities
  * …made with a secure by default configuration
  * …made in such a way that security updates may be automatically applied within an appropriate time frame
  * …and more.

Manufacturers must report on actively exploited vulnerabilities and severe incidents via an ENISA-run single reporting platform, as laid out in [Article 16]

* …in the way described in [Article 14(2)]
  * …submit an early warning if actively exploited vulnerabilities within 24 hours of discovery
  * …submit all relevant details about the nature of the exploit, without delay and within 72 hours
  * …submit a final report including available mitigations, within 14 days.

Manufacturers are required to **report discovered vulnerabilities in components to their maintainers**,
and **share modifications developed to address the vulnerability with their maintainers**,
as laid out in [Article 13(6)]:

Manufacturers shall, upon identifying a vulnerability in a component, including in an open source-component, […]

* …in accordance with instructions laid out in [Annex I, part II]
  * …identify and document the vulnerability, including by drawing up an SBOM covering at minimum the top-level dependencies involved
  * …depending on risk posed, provide without delay a security update that addresses the vulnerability
  * …apply regular tests and reviews of the security of the product
  * …publicly share information about the vulnerability, it's impact and relevance, and how to remediate it
  * …publish and enforce a policy for coordinated vulnerability disclosure
  * …facilitate information sharing about vulnerabilities in the product and the components it uses
  * …provide mechanisms to securely distribute fixes in a timely manner
* …report the vulnerability to the person […] maintaining the component,
* …and address and remediate the vulnerability in accordance with the vulnerability handling requirements set out in [Annex I, part II].
* …and where manufacturers have developed a […] modification to address the vulnerability in that component,
  * they shall share the relevant code or documentation with the person […] maintaining the component, […].


Manufacturers are to draw up the EU declaration of conformity in accordance with [Article 28] and affix the CE marking in accordance with [Article 30] as laid out in [Article 13(12)]

* …to indicate conformity prior to entering the market ([Article 30(3)])
* …and keep records for ten years, as laid out in [Article 23(2)]

Manufacturers must provide a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) upon request by authorities, as laid out in [Recital (77)]
* …but no need for making these public.

#### Authorised representatives of Manufacturers  ⚠️  FIXME: Not done

> [!NOTE] See [Article 13], [Article 14], [Article 15], [Article 16], and [Article 17] for context.

Obligations for Authorised representatives of Manufacturers are laid out in [Article 18]

* …Testing necessary, provide technical documentation, as laid out in [Article 13(6)]
* …Vulnerability management
* …perform risk assessments
* …Coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) policy mandatory

* …offer support for their products for at least 5 years, security updates for 10 years


### Importers

Importers shall place on the market only products with digital elements that comply with the essential requirements set out in [Annex I, Part I] and where the processes put in place by the manufacturer comply with the essential requirements set out in [Annex I, Part II] – as laid out in [Article 19(1)]


### Distributors ⚠️  FIXME: Not done

When making a product with digital elements available on the market, distributors shall act with due care in relation to the requirements set out in this Regulation.

Before making a product with digital elements available on the market, distributors shall verify that:

* (a) the product with digital elements bears the CE marking;
* (b) the manufacturer and the importer have complied with the obligations set out in [Article 13(15)], [Article 16], [Article 18], [Article 19] and [Article 20] and have provided all necessary documents to the distributor.


### Open Source Stewards ⚠️  FIXME: Not done

Open Source Software Stewards are…

* […] legal persons who *provide support on a sustained basis* ([Article 3] (14)) for the development […] of products which are intended for commercial activities, and who *play a main role in ensuring the viability of those products* […] ([Recital (19)])
  * […] should be subject to a light-touch and tailor-made regulatory regime.
  * [and…] only cover […] free and open-source software that are ultimately intended for commercial activities.

Open Source Stewards are obliged to…

* …facilitate the Manufacturer's _due diligence_ obligation set out in [Article 13(5)]
* …provide a cybersecurity policy for voluntary reporting of vulnerabilities, as laid out in [Article 15]
* …cooperate with market surveillance authorities and provide documentation. ⚠️  FIXME: (Dis)confirm this.
* …report on actively exploited vulnerabilities and severe incidents via an ENISA-run single reporting platform (as laid out in [Article 16], in the way described in [Article 14].

FOSS Software may get a voluntary security attestation, as described in [Article 25] ⚠️  FIXME: (Dis)confirm this.

* …using an EU Attestation program as laid out in [Recital (21)]
  * …by requesting a certification from ENISA, as laid out in [Regulation (EU) 2019/881, Article 48](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881#page=8)
  * …in such a way that this security attestation can be initiated or financed by not only FOSS projects, but also by others, including manufacturers, users, or public administrations.
  * …so this Attestation becomes a "proof of due diligence exercised"? ⚠️  FIXME: (Dis)confirm this.
* …to facilitate Manufacturers' obligations to exercise due diligence when integrating components from third parties.

Furthermore, the OSS Software Stewards are only subject to a "light-touch" and "tailor-made" regulatory regime, ans are not to be considered as Manufacturers.

Additionally,

* The mere circumstances under which the product with digital elements has been developed, or how the development has been financed, should therefore not be taken into account when determining the commercial or non-commercial nature of that activity. ([Recital (18)])
* […] the development of […] free and open-source software by *not-for-profit organisations* should not be considered to be a commercial activity provided that the organisation is set up in such a way that ensures that all earnings after costs are used to achieve not-for-profit objectives. ([Recital (18)])

### Maintainers

* CRA does not apply to you, as long as…
  * You are providing Free and Open Source Software (as mentioned in [Recital (18)])



#### Who does the CRA apply to? ([Recital (15)])

This Regulation applies to [economic operators](glossary.md#economic-operator) only in relation to products with digital [elements made available on the market](glossary.md#making-available-on-the-market) hence supplied for distribution or use on the Union market _in the course of a commercial activity_.

Supply _in the course of a commercial activity_ might be characterised […]

* by charging a price for a product with digital elements […]
* by charging a price for technical support services
  * where this does not serve only the recuperation of actual costs,
* by an intention to monetise,
  * for instance by providing a software platform through which the manufacturer monetises other services,
* by requiring as a condition for use the processing of personal data
  * for reasons other than exclusively for improving the security, compatibility or interoperability of the software, or
* by accepting donations
  * exceeding the costs associated with the design, development and provision of a product with digital elements.

Accepting donations without the intention of making a profit should not be considered to be a commercial activity


#### On Open Source software _intended for use in the course of a commercial activity_ ([Recital (18)])

* Free and open-source software is understood as software the source code of which is openly shared
  * and the licensing of which provides for all rights to make it
    * freely accessible, usable, modifiable and redistributable.

* Free and open-source software is developed, maintained and distributed openly,
  * including via online platforms.

* In relation to economic operators that fall within the scope of this Regulation,
  * only free and open-source software made available on the market,
    * and therefore supplied for distribution or use _in the course of a commercial activity,_
  * should fall within the scope of this Regulation.

* The mere circumstances under which the product with digital elements has been developed,
  * or how the development has been financed,
    * should therefore not be taken into account when determining the commercial or non-commercial nature of that activity.
  * More specifically, for the purposes of this Regulation
    * and in relation to the economic operators that fall within its scope,
      * to ensure that there is a clear distinction between the development and supply phases,
    * the provision of products with digital elements qualifying as free and open-source software
      * that are not monetised by their manufacturers
    * should not be considered to be a commercial activity.

* Furthermore, **the supply of** products with digital elements
  * qualifying as **free and open-source software components**
    * **intended for integration by other manufacturers** into their own products with digital elements
  * **should be considered making available on the market**
    * **only if the component is monetised** by its original manufacturer.

* For instance,
  * the mere fact that an open-source software product with digital elements
    * receives financial support from manufacturers
    * or that manufacturers contribute to the development of such a product
  * should not in itself determine that the activity is of commercial nature.

* In addition,
  * the mere presence of regular releases
  * should not in itself lead to the conclusion that a product with digital elements
    * is supplied in the course of a commercial activity.

* Finally, for the purposes of this Regulation,
  * the **development of** products with digital elements
    * qualifying as **free and open-source software**
    * **by not-for-profit organisations**
    * **should not be considered to be a commercial activity**
      * **provided** that the organisation is set up in such a way
      * that ensures that **all earnings after costs are used to achieve not-for-profit objectives**.

* This Regulation does not apply to
  * natural or legal persons
    * who contribute with source code to products with digital elements
      * qualifying as free and open-source software
      * that are not under their responsibility.


#### Open questions

* "Commission shall publish guidance to assist economic operators in applying this Regulation"
  * 
* Who gives out attestations?
  * Under what terms?
  * Can these attestations be used as a "value add" to existing components in such a way that may be sold by Stewards to fund it's work and it's community.
