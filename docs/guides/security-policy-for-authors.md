title: Guidelines for Adding a Security Policy to Perl Distributions
description: A guide for including a Security Policy in a CPAN distribution is to advise users how to report security issues, and how these issues will be handled.
toc: true
---

## Purpose

The purpose of including a Security Policy in a CPAN distribution is to advise users how to report security issues, and how these issues will be handled.


### Why should authors add a security policy?

A security policy tells users how to report security issues to the
project maintainer(s), how the maintainer(s) will respond, and what
software will be supported by them.


### Why should authors work with CPANSec?

The CPAN Security Group (CPANSec) a forum for coordinating and
assisting in resolving security issues found on CPAN.  This includes:

- Assisting authors and third-party developers in dealing with
  vulnerabilities and general security advisories related to
  distributions indexed on Perlâ€™s package ecosystem, CPAN;

- Acting as a trusted intermediator for reporting potential security
  vulnerabilities to distributions, including managing and responsible
  disclosure of embargoed security information for a reasonable amount
  of time pertaining non-core distributions on CPAN, and communication
  with package managers and distribution channels;

- Sharing and documenting best security practices to authors and
  users;

See the [CPANSec Charter](https://security.metacpan.org/docs/charter.html)
for more information.


## The format of the security policy

The security policy should be a text document with minimal formatting
that can be read without a specialised reader, with the name
`SECURITY` and a suffix to indicate the markup (`.md` for markdown,
`.pod` for POD or optionally `.txt`).

More complex markup formats like HTML are not recommended.

The all caps filename is intended to indicate that this is an
important document on par with `README`, `LICENSE`, `INSTALL` and
`CONTRIBUTING`.  This will also differentiate the file from `security.txt`
which has a specific machine-readable format and has a different function
[\[4\]](#references-and-notes) (Securitytxt).

The file should have the following sections.

1. Abstract
   - A short one or two sentences that explain what this document is.
2. How to report a security vulnerability
   - How to contact the project maintainers, and what to expect as a response.
3. What this policy applies to
   - Which versions of the software are supported
4. Installation and usage issues
5. Workflow.

Sections 2 (How to report a security vulnerability) and 3 (Which
versions of the software are supported) are the most important, and
must be present in a security policy.

### Abstract

This is a short one or two sentences that explain what this document
is, e.g.

> This is the Security Policy for the CPAN distribution `Foo-Bar`.

If the project has a web site, with this security policy posted on the
website, then you should refer to that URL, e.g.:

> The latest version of this Security Policy can be found on the
> Foo-Bar website at https://foobar.example.com/security-policy

If the project does not have a dedicated website, then a link to the
project's software repository should be used, e.g.

> The latest version of the Security Policy can be found in the git
> repository for Foo-Bar in the main branch at https://example.github.com/foobar

If your security policy is based on the advice of this document, then
you should mention that, along with the version:

> This text is based on the CPAN Security Group's Guidelines for Adding
> a Security Policy to Perl Distributions (version 1.1.0)
> https://security.metacpan.org/docs/guides/security-policy-for-authors.html

#### Links from other module documentation

If the module documentation or `README` has a section on reporting
bugs, then wording should be added that refers users to the security
policy, for example (in POD):

```pod
=head2 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Security issues should not be reported on the bugtracker website.
Please see F<SECURITY.md> for instructions how to report security
vulnerabilities.
```


### How to report a security vulnerability

At the bare minimum, your security policy should provide a current
package maintainer's email address (or ideally an alias that forwards
to multiple maintainers, or a bug reporting system that supports
special handling of security issues).

It is important to refer to the current project maintainers, and not
the package authors, who for older packages may be different.

For example,

> Security vulnerabilities can be reported by e-mail to the current
> project maintainer(s) at <foobar@example.com>.

or [\[1\]](#references-and-notes) (Github-Sec-Advisory)

> Security vulnerabilities can be reported via our GitHub repository
> at https://example.github.com/foobar.  On the "Advisories" page you
> can click on the "Report a vulnerability" button.

or

> Security vulnerabilities can be reported via our GitLab repository a
> https://gitlab.com/foobarkeepers/foobar/issues.  When reporting the
> issue, please check the tickbox on the form labelled "This issue is
> confidential and should only be visible to team members".

We recommend that there be a *single point of contact*.  Do not
provide a list of multiple email addresses or web pages and ask that
users contact some or all of these addresses.

Please ensure that the security contact information is consistent with
distribution metadata, e.g. in the `META.json` file
[\[3\]](#references-and-notes) (CPAN-Meta-Spec).

Add a reminder to include details for verifying the bug:

> Please include as many details as possible, including code samples
> or test cases, so that we can reproduce the issue.  Check that your
> report does not expose any sensitive data, such as passwords,
> tokens, or personal information.

We recommend that you add note about also copying CPANSec on the
notification if help is required triaging the issue, or if the issue
is being actively exploited.  CPANSec provides support to reporters
and maintainers in assessing the appropriate response, and in case the
maintainer(s) are unreachable.  For example

> If you would like any help with triaging the issue, or if the issue
> is being actively exploited, please copy the report to the CPAN
> Security Group (CPANSec) at <cpan-security@security.metacpan.org>.

It is important to advise users not to report security
vulnerabilities in public, e.g.

> Please *do not* use the public issue reporting system on RT or
> GitHub issues for reporting security vulnerabilities.
>
> Please do not disclose the security vulnerability in public forums
> until past any proposed date for public disclosure, or it has been
> made public by the maintainers or CPANSec.  That includes patches or
> pull requests.

You can also link to the CPANSec page

> For more information, see _Report a Security Issue_
> https://security.metacpan.org/docs/report.html on the CPANSec
> website.

#### What to expect for a response

Advise users what to expect in terms of a response.  If there is a
formal vulnerability workflow then refer to that section of the
document.

Include a recommendation to report the issue to CPANSec after a
certain amount of time without a response from the author(s).  For
example

> The maintainer(s) aim to acknowledge your security report within
> three days (72 hours).  However, this project is maintained by a
> small group of volunteers in their spare time.  If you have not
> heard back from the maintainers within 72 hours, then please forward
> the report to CPANSec at <cpan-security@security.metacpan.org>.

It is reasonable that small projects with a single part time
maintainer cannot promise a response time.  An alternative might be

> The maintainer(s) aim to acknowledge your security report as soon as
> possible.  However, this project is maintained by a single person in
> their spare time, and they cannot guarantee a rapid response.  If you
> have not received a response from them within a week, then
> please send a reminder to them and copy the report to CPANSec at
> <cpan-security@security.metacpan.org>.

Also add a note about the initial response:

> Note that the initial response to your report will be an
> acknowledgement, with a possible query for more information.  It
> will not necessarily include any fixes for the issue.

Also note on which conditions you may forward the security issue to
other people.  For example,

> The project maintainer(s) may forward this issue to the security
> contacts for other projects where we believe it is relevant.  This
> may include embedded libraries, system libraries, prerequisite
> modules or downstream software that uses this software.
>
> They may also forward this issue to CPANSec.

### What Software This Policy Applies To

This section discusses what software this applies to, and what are
considered security issues in the software, and what are not
considered security issues.  For example,

> Any security vulnerabilities in Foo-Bar are covered by this policy.
>
> Security vulnerabilities are considered anything that allows users
> to execute unauthorised code, access unauthorised resources, or to
> have an adverse impact on accessibility or performance of a system.
>
> Security vulnerabilities in upstream software (embedded libraries,
> prerequisite modules or system libraries, or in Perl), are not
> covered by this policy unless they affect Foo-Bar, or Foo-Bar can
> be used to exploit vulnerabilities in them.
>
> Security vulnerabilities in downstream software (any software that
> uses Foo-Bar, or plugins to it that are not included with the
> Foo-Bar distribution) are not covered by this policy.

#### Which versions of this software are supported?

There should be a section or subsection that identifies which versions
of the software will be supported for security fixes.  For example,

> The maintainer(s) will release security fixes for the latest version
> of Foo-Bar.

or if there are multiple versions that will be supported, that should
be noted. For example,

> For security vulnerabilities, the maintainer(s) will release fixes
> for the last two major versions of Foo-Bar.  As of this release,
> that is `v1.4.x` and `v1.6.x`.

(Note a disadvantage of mentioning specific versions in a security
policy is that it will need to be updated with each release.)

If the maintainers only support specific Perl versions, e.g. Perl
versions released in the last ten years, then they might want that to
be noted in the security policy. For example,

> Note that the Foo-Bar project only supports major versions of Perl
> released in the past ten (10) years, even though Foo-Bar will run on
> older versions of Perl.  If a security fix requires the maintainers
> to increase the minimum version of Perl that is supported, then they
> may do so.

Note that if a Perl version support policy is mentioned elsewhere in
the module documentation, then the above statement may be considered
unnecessary.

If the software uses or embeds external libraries, then the supported
versions of those libraries should also be noted.

### Installation and usage issues

This is an optional section.

It is also worth noting how it works with prerequisites, for example,

> This software uses the zlib library for accessing gzip-encoded
> streams and files.  The minimum requirement is zlib v1.2.  However,
> there may be security vulnerabilities and you should use v1.2.13 or
> newer.

or

> The distribution metadata specifies minimum versions of
> prerequisites that are required for Foo-Bar to work.  However, some
> of these prerequisites may have security vulnerabilities, and you
> should ensure that you are using up-to-date versions of these
> prerequisites.
>
> Where security vulnerabilities are known, the metadata may indicate
> newer versions as recommended.

Note that while security issues can occur due to unsafe defaults or
the misuse of software libraries, it is still worth adding a section
that highlights usage issues.  For example,

> The "foo" method only validates that filenames passed to it exist.
> It cannot determine whether it should process those files.  You
> should ensure that arbitrary filenames are not passed to it, and
> should validate any external data that is used for generating the
> filename.

It is acceptable to refer readers to specific sections of the module
documentation rather than duplicate content.

### Workflow

This is an optional section.

Larger projects, or projects maintained by organisations with their
own general security policies, may have a vulnerability workflow.
Where applicable, the workflow should be discussed, or a link provided
to that document.

For example, see [\[2\]](#references-and-notes) (Perl-Sec-Policy).

## Examples

### Single Maintainer

An example `SECURITY.md` for a CPAN distribution with a single
maintainer that should cover most cases.

```markdown
This is the Security Policy for the Perl Foo-Bar distribution.

The latest version of the Security Policy can be found in the
[git repository for Foo-Bar](https://example.github.com/foobar).

This text is based on the CPAN Security Group's Guidelines for Adding
a Security Policy to Perl Distributions (version 1.1.0)
https://security.metacpan.org/docs/guides/security-policy-for-authors.html

# How to Report a Security Vulnerability

Security vulnerabilities can be reported by e-mail to the current
project maintainers at <foobar@example.com>.

Please include as many details as possible, including code samples
or test cases, so that we can reproduce the issue.  Check that your
report does not expose any sensitive data, such as passwords,
tokens, or personal information.

If you would like any help with triaging the issue, or if the issue
is being actively exploited, please copy the report to the CPAN
Security Group (CPANSec) at <cpan-security@security.metacpan.org>.

Please *do not* use the public issue reporting system on RT or
GitHub issues for reporting security vulnerabilities.

Please do not disclose the security vulnerability in public forums
until past any proposed date for public disclosure, or it has been
made public by the maintainers or CPANSec.  That includes patches or
pull requests.

For more information, see
[Report a Security Issue](https://security.metacpan.org/docs/report.html)
on the CPANSec website.

## Response to Reports

The maintainer(s) aim to acknowledge your security report as soon as
possible.  However, this project is maintained by a single person in
their spare time, and they cannot guarantee a rapid response.  If you
have not received a response from them within a week, then
please send a reminder to them and copy the report to CPANSec at
<cpan-security@security.metacpan.org>.

Please note that the initial response to your report will be an
acknowledgement, with a possible query for more information.  It
will not necessarily include any fixes for the issue.

The project maintainer(s) may forward this issue to the security
contacts for other projects where we believe it is relevant.  This
may include embedded libraries, system libraries, prerequisite
modules or downstream software that uses this software.

They may also forward this issue to CPANSec.

# Which Software This Policy Applies To

Any security vulnerabilities in Foo-Bar are covered by this policy.

Security vulnerabilities are considered anything that allows users
to execute unauthorised code, access unauthorised resources, or to
have an adverse impact on accessibility or performance of a system.

Security vulnerabilities in upstream software (embedded libraries,
prerequisite modules or system libraries, or in Perl), are not
covered by this policy unless they affect Foo-Bar, or Foo-Bar can
be used to exploit vulnerabilities in them.

Security vulnerabilities in downstream software (any software that
uses Foo-Bar, or plugins to it that are not included with the
Foo-Bar distribution) are not covered by this policy.

## Supported Versions of Foo-Bar

The maintainer(s) will release security fixes for the latest version
of Foo-Bar.

Note that the Foo-Bar project only supports major versions of Perl
released in the past ten (10) years, even though Foo-Bar will run on
older versions of Perl.  If a security fix requires the maintainers to
increase the minimum version of Perl that is supported, then they may
do so.

# Installation and Usage Issues

The distribution metadata specifies minimum versions of
prerequisites that are required for Foo-Bar to work.  However, some
of these prerequisites may have security vulnerabilities, and you
should ensure that you are using up-to-date versions of these
prerequisites.

Where security vulnerabilities are known, the metadata may indicate
newer versions as recommended.

## Usage

Please see the software documentation for further information.
