Welcome to the [CPAN Security Working Group](https://security.metacpan.org/).
This is a community effort for supporting and responding to security incidents on CPAN – the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network.

This group also cares about other security-related concerns with CPAN distributions, the CPAN/PAUSE infrastructure, and security conserns aroun tooling and the ecosystem in general. This includes improving supply chain security, making CPAN become a more secure and trustworthy publishing platform, and more.
