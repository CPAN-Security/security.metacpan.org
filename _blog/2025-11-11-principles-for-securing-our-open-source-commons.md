excerpt: "8 Principles for interacting with the open source software projects – and people – you depend on"
---

With the introduction of the EU Cyber Resilience Act in the European Union, cybersecurity is required to become a primary aspect of product development, starting in 2027.
A major part of this activity will relate to mapping out product dependencies, and ensure that each and every one of these are taken care of appropriately.
The vast majority of these dependencies are likely to be Open Source components, and many of these are likely to get increased scrutiny from manufacturers.
How may stakeholders avoid alienating the maintainers they rely on?

Here are a few thoughts that may go into "a list of principles for interacting with Open Source maintainers and their communities".

## Background – What is "Due Diligence"?

When ensuring your technology bedrock is secure, you are expected to conduct yourself with reasonable _Due Care_ and prepare for this by doing your _Due Diligence_.
_Due Care_ is about _what a reasonable person is expected to do_ in case of an emergency, and _Due Diligence_ is about _what preparations are needed for this reasonable person to succeed_.
When an integrator or manufacturer prepares for _Due Care_, they may want to take a hard look at what open source communities they depend on, and conduct the due diligence necessary for them to continue cooperating with you in a sustainable and responsive manner.
These projects are part of your infrastructure, and since these are Open Source, you have the opportunity to contribute to improving this infrastructure.
As long as you take into account the licenses, terms and ways of working for each component project, you may find ways to lower any risks associated.
In short, ensuring the Open Source projects you depend on are sustainable, is part of your "Due Diligence".

## 8 principles about open source communities

1. **Most of your digital infrastructure is in the commons** – The Open Source components, their communities, and the ecosystems your business uses as a digital bedrock, are almost exclusively produced in the open, with volunteer effort.
If you rely on these in a substantial way, then you rely on these _volunteers_.
Let this fact sink in for a moment.

2. **There is no unified Open Source community** – while a few of these communities are well-known, and therefore well-organized and well-resourced, you'll find these on the left side of the power law graph.
Expect that a substantial portion of your dependencies are found in the "long tail" part on the right of this graph.
Check your assumptions on how to interact with these, and their needs you should take into account.

3. **Don't think only of your third party suppliers** – You do not have contracts with the Open Source communities you rely on, and they are not your suppliers.
Instead, consider them as your "Open Source colleagues", "second-party suppliers", or "digital infrastructure partners" and treat them accordingly.
Assume that you both have a genuine interest in the correctness, resiliency, reliability and usefulness of their code, and therefore have common goals and reasons to collaborate.
If you decide to think of them as a "third party supplier" despite this fact, then please accept that they have no reason to treat you differently.
Ask yourself – "Why should they care about you?" – You are not part of their community of "second parties", you are just an incidental "third party" user.

4. **Your open source bedrock is stabilized and supported by _you_** – You may be relying on thousands, if not tens of thousands of components and their maintainers; Interacting with all of them is daunting, if not impossible – therefore, prioritize (perform a risk assessment), and look for – and promote – predictability, reliability and responsiveness in the communities on the top of your list.
This is to foster trust these communities, so they may continue providing a safe and secure foundation for your business.
In the meantime, you retain the freedom to verify this, thanks to them publishing under the terms of an open source license.
Look for ways to strengthen the communities where the need is the greatest – not only in the large and "important" parts of your infrastructure, but also the smaller ones who have communities that may be resource-starved or crumbling.

5. **Open Source was never free** – The cost of creating and maintaining your infrastructure was never free.
The cost for you was always _externalized_, meaning that you benefited from other people's investments of time and attention.
While assuming this will always be the case is reckless, there's no need to despair – the infrastructure is still maintained collaboratively.
Your experiences and resources are still welcome, and is likely to offer cheaper and less risky solutions than what you gain from switching to something else or rewriting your digital foundation.

6. **Maintainers aren't motivated by pay** – Instead, they _enjoy_.
They may be learning, helping, playing or just creating something they can _be proud of_, or that they may _complete_.
Whatever their intrinsic motivation is, they spend their one irreplaceable, non-refundable resource on it: Their time and attention.
And when they meet others with the same or similar interests, they may find out they created fertile ground for forming friendships.
Bringing a transactional mindset into this, ought to rightfully be considered akin to someone saying "If I give you $100, will you be my friend?"
