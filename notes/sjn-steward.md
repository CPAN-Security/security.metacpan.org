OSS Steward

> * a legal person
>   * (not Manufacturer) who
> * has the purpose or objective of
>   * systematically providing support
>     * on a sustained basis
>   * for the development of 
>     * specific [OSS PDEs intended for commercial activities] and
>   * that ensures the viability of those products
>
> — (Article 24)

- Provide (Article 25) Security attestations for
  - Article 13(5) Due diligence performed by Maintainers in cooperation with the Steward and the Manufacturers
  - …
- Offer (Article 13(6)) contribution obligation fulfillment statements.
- Put in place and document a cybersecurity policy (Article 15)
  - foster development of secure Products with Digital Elements
  - foster effective handling of vulnerabilities by the developers of that product
    - taking into account the specific nature of the open-source software steward
    - and the legal and organisational arrangements to which it is subject
  - foster voluntary reporting of vulnerabilities (Article 15) by the product developers
  - help document, address and remediate vulnerabilities
  - help promote the sharing of information concerning discovered vulnerabilities within OSS community
- Cooperate with market surveillance authorities, at their request (Article 24)
  - mitigate cybersecurity risks posed by PDEs with OSS
- Report on vulnerabilities & severe incidents to the extent they’re involved in the development of PDEs,
  - to designated CSIRTs/ENISA/users (Article 14(1), Article 14(3), Article 14(8))

### Other activities

- Notarizing BOMs
- Automating BOM sharing, payment, access to attestations, etc.
- Possible tasks
  - Confirm quality of metadata, packaging, contact points, distribution
  - Steward as co-maintainer?
- Stewards offering a freelance job marketplace
- Exposing the availability of transitive attestations, given the presence of one component

### Arguments

- Maintenance is not free
- Due diligence requires attention from code owners
  - more attention for "full autopsies" than for "cursory sanity checks"
- Countering notification fatigue among manufacturers with massive dependency graphs
- Facilitate the application of [Kerckhoffs’ principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle) (everything about a system should be public knowledge, except the keys) in the implementation and securing of business-critical digital infrastructure.
