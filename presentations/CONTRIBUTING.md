If you're giving a presentation that is related to CPANSec, please add it to the README.md file.

You may also write your slides in a markdown file (see examples in this directory), and have it updated when running `make` here.

### How to generate a presentation from markdown

These pages are generated with dadoomer's markdown-slides tool and Reveal.js.
Please see these separate projects for license and usage terms.

* Dadoomer's [markdown-slides](https://github.com/dadoomer/markdown-slides)
* [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com)

After installing markdown-slides, you should be able to build your presentations
by just running `make` in the presentations directory.
