## About this document (TL;DR) {#about}

This document offers **an overview of [Open Source Software](glossary.md#open-source-software) Supply-chains**.

* Taking into account the following perspectives:
    1. Environments and Ecosystems,
    1. Roles,
    1. Metadata, and
    1. Industry [Terms and Concepts](glossary.md)
* …Enumerating and describing the Metadata Attributes these Roles typically care about.
* …Noting the ways each Role may Operate on any given Metadata Attribute,
    * 🟥 Create (authoritative),
    * 🟨 Assemble or Update (non-authoritative),
    * 🟩 Distribute,
    * 🟦 Verify, or
    * 🟪 Censor
* …Showing any relevant regulation or other requirements that impose expectations of the presence of specific Metadata Attributes.
* …So that people having a Role within the Supply-chain can:
    1. Draw an overarching map of what other Roles may Operate within their Supply-chain
    1. Form a idea of what purpose each Role may have, and find out where they fit
    1. Get an idea where an Attribute is likely to come from, and which Roles care about these
    1. Become aware of both upstream and downstream Communities, Ecosystems and Environments are involved in their Supply-chain, in order to interact with them in effective and sustainable ways
    1. Use this information to both live up to their new Regulatory Obligations and to help improve their Security Posture in general

## This document is **visionary** and a **proposal**

Some aspects of this document – specifically those related to the role of Open Source Stewards and the role of OSS Attestations – are presented as **suggestions, proposals or visions of a possible future**.


### Motivation

Originally, this document stems from the main author's frustration with the lack of a clear Open Source perspective in current SBOM documentation (as of 2023). This brought him to the SBOM devroom at FOSDEM 2024 to offer [a rant](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3358-can-sboms-become-first-class-citizens-in-open-source-ecosystems-/) about what he perceived as a less-than-ideal state of affairs.

Furthermore, this document is also an attempt to explore and map out the consequences that the EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) is likely have for Open Source Ecosystems.
The CRA is the first regulation that has language that explicitly affects Open Source ecosystems.
This law introduces a new entity – the Open Source Software Steward – with obligations to them (and other Roles) to improve the state of Cybersecurity throughout Open Source Supply-chains.
This shown us that there's a need to map out what Open Source Supply-chains actually look like, and spell out what Roles can be found throughout it, and more.
This document therefore also represents the author's exploration of this topic, and could be considered as "public notes" on the matter.
Still, the author hopes this document also can be useful for others than himself and the CPAN Security Group.

Please take this document as it is – a public set of notes, intended as a source for illumination and as an ongoing conversation – taking incremental steps toward more transparent and accountable Open Source supply-chains.

## Supply-chain Ecosystems, Environments & Roles and Attributes

> [!NOTE]
> FIXME: Show how metadata may be communicated along these open source supply-chains.

In this section, we map out the different parts of typical Open Source Supply-chains – the Environments and Ecosystems we use, the Roles that are operating within these, what Metadata Attributes they care about, and which Operations they are expected to execute when caring.
Additionally, you should get some indications of what regulations, standards or other requirements that call for the presence of a given Attribute.
And all this, with the goal of allowing downstream users to both live up to their regulatory obligations and to improve their security posture in general.
To improve by ensuring that the metadata they need is available, updated and authoritative, and can be helpful in both mitigating vulnerabilities and interacting with the maintainers of any Open Source projects that may be involved.

### Legend of Metadata Operations

In the graphs presented above and below, we color-code the different _metadata operations_ in order to quickly show what activities a Supply-chain Role may be involved in.

We're also assuming that Metadata is stored in SBOMs, but this need not be the case.
To distinguish between Metadata roles and Supply-chain roles, we have decided to refer to the former as "SBOM Roles".
This convention is also commonly used (or implied) in the referenced material.
This may change in later revisions of this document.

Some of the information here is based on CISA's "SBOM Sharing Roles and Considerations" recommendations ([CISA-2024](#references)) and other public documents, [referenced](#references) below.

We also distinguish between SBOM Authors that are _Authoritative_ sources for Attributes ("[SBOM Author](#sbom-author-role)") and _Non-authoritative_ sources ("[SBOM Contributor](#sbom-contributor-role)"), in addition SBOM Distributors and Consumers.
The Authoritative/Non-authoritative distinction is important so everyone is clear about where a given Metadata Attribute originally comes from.
This distinction is _not commonly used_ in the referenced material.

And finally, we acknowledge that some situations may call for an SBOM Censor, which is the time of writing is _not a commonly used term_ in the referenced material.

* 🟥 SBOM Author (Authoritative metadata provider) – **Creates**, defines, signs Metadata — _**Authoritative** roles make sure the metadata and related artifacts they are the author of, **Exist**_.
* 🟨 SBOM Contributor (Non-authoritative metadata provider) – **Assembles**, **updates**, merges, refines, maintains, attests, annotates Metadata — _**Non-authoritative** roles make sure the metadata and related artifacts they process, are **Updated** and **Corrected**_.
* 🟩 SBOM Distributor – **Distributes**, curates, indexes Metadata — _**Distributing** roles make sure the metadata and related artifacts they have, are made **Available** to others_.
* 🟦 SBOM Consumer – **Verifies**, consumes, aggregates, validates, surveys, analyzes or reports Metadata — _**Consuming** roles makes sure the metadata and related artifacts they consume, are **Complete**, **Compliant** and **Used**_.
* 🟪 SBOM Censor – **Censors**, redacts, deletes, anonymizes or filters Metadata — _**Censoring** roles make sure that certain metadata about related artifacts are **Prevented** from being shared with others_.


## Open Source Supply-chain

> [!NOTE]
> The graphs in this document do *not* include _Content Delivery Networks_, _Model Ecosystems_ or _Plugin Ecosystems_.
> If you know of other parts of an Open Source Supply-chain that involves the managing of metadata somehow, then please [reach out](#document-status--)!
> We'd love to add them – or at least to be aware of them.

## Supply-chain Ecosystems, their Roles and Metadata

Which environments and Ecosystems are found throughout a Supply-chain? Here's an overview.

Throughout Open Source Supply-chains, we find different Roles that care about certain metadata, or are in possession of some authoritative information, or needs to verify these.
Here, you'll get an overview of the most important ones, which attributes they care about and how they care, and some information about why they do so (e.g. due to legal requirements).

* Ops: The type of operation that someone with a given Role is most likely to do on a given metadata attribute.
    * See the [Typical Metadata Operations](#typical-metadata-operations) section describing what the colors represent.
* Attribute name: The name of the metadata field in question.
    * These attributes may differ across relevant sources and regulations.
    * Equivalent to terms like "field name" "metadata field".
* Required: CPANSec interpretation on whether or not the attribute is required.
* Required by: Reference to relevant regulation, guides or standards where the attribute is mentioned.
    * See the [References](#references) section for links to the documents mentioned.
* Comment: CPANSec commentary on a attribute.
* FIXME: CPANSec Remaining work related to this attribute.


### Environment-independent Baseline Attributes

These are common across all roles, and considered to be _baseline_ because they are required independently of the Roles' needs.

| Ops | Attribute name           | Required | Required by                         | Comment | FIXME   |

#### Maintainer

A contributing author or developer of an Open Source component project, though not necessarily the original [Author](#author).

* Operates within an [OSS Project Environment](#oss-project-environment).
* Is usually the initial and/or main creator of the component in question.
* Typically works on all aspects of the code, including features, bug fixes, tests and security issues.
* Has the final say on the original contents of the package, and it's name-spaces.
* The Maintainer _can_ be a group of people (having co-maintainers), though a single point of responsibility is common.
* If a Maintainer has upstream (reverse) dependencies, the Maintainer is also considered to be an [Developer](#developer) (as seen from the upstream Maintainer's perspective).
* Not to be confused with the [SBOM Author](#sbom-author-role) role.
* Other common names for this role include Author, Developer, [Owner](#owner--supplier-).

### Package Ecosystem

A package ecosystem [patches](#patcher), [repackages](#packager), [curates](#curator), [indexes and hosts](#distributor) either components for a specific OS distributions, or [collections](#assembler) of components for use in container registries, made available (published) for easy download and use.
Package Ecosystems typically have their own tooling and services that are expected to be used when interacting with them.

* Examples of package systems: APT (Debian, Ubuntu), RPM (AlmaLinux, SuSE), Ports (FreeBSD)
* Examples of container systems: Docker Hub
* May have upstream package ecosystems
* May have downstream package ecosystems
* May be Public
* May be Private


#### Patcher

> [!CAUTION]
> * FIXME – Not done

Patchers may select and apply updates to a component before building and/or packaging.

* Operates like a [Developer](#developer) within a [Package Ecosystem](#package-ecosystem).
* Vets and applies changes to a component, including…
    * Back-ports of features,
    * Security fixes,
    * Other accommodations necessary for distributing multiple parallel releases of the same upstream project,
    * Adopts a component to make it conform to build and execution environment demands.
* May work within publishing constraints decided by a [Curator](#curator) of the Ecosystem (e.g. LTS releases, support contracts, etc.).
* May work both with a downstream or their own Ecosystem [Packager](#packager).
* May have a [Maintainer](#maintainer)'s downstream ecosystems as their upstream.
* Is a role that often is held by the same person as the [Packager](#packager) or [Builder](#builder).
* May also be found in-house (e.g. a business or [Manufacturer](#manufacturer) who uses a company-internal package mirror)
* May work on preparing patches for a Package Ecosystem provider (e.g. applying back-ports of fixes in Debian packages), or a Language Ecosystem provider (e.g. a company-internal CPAN mirror that distributes patched packages).
* Some patches may contain substantial modifications and be based on the Packager's judgement and opinions.

This role is necessary when...

* Upstream Maintainer roles are not responsive or available, and thereby security fixes aren't applied there.
* When downstream constraints and requirements call for it – e.g. when back-porting of fixes are needed due to downstream LTS requirements.

* Examples
    * In Debian, there is a concept of "Non-Maintainer Uploads", where contributors are allowed to do one-time uploads to fix bugs under certain conditions and following some guidelines. (Source: [Debian developers reference](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/developers-reference/pkgs.en.html#non-maintainer-uploads-nmus), [perl5-porters message on NMUs](https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2024/08/msg268757.html))


#### Builder

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Builders should add build environment metadata (including resolved dependencies) in an accompanying SBOM file.

* See also
    * [Packager](#packager)
    * [Assembler](#assembler)
    * [Deployer](#deployer)


#### Packager

> [!NOTE]
> * Packagers take upstream components from an upstream source and build and install them into a custom environment for producing system packages for their native packaging ecosystem (e.g. APT).
> * Upstream sources may be…
>     * Author's repository, or a Custodian's if a project is dormant (e.g. a repository on Codeberg).
>     * Language-specific packages distributed by a Language Ecosystem (e.g. CPAN).
> * E.g. someone in the #debian-perl group downloads, builds, tests and installs something from CPAN, but instead of doing a regular install, they us tooling like `dh-make-perl` to produce a custom installation directory that can be incorporated into a .deb archive.
> * A Packager can both be found in-house (e.g. a business who uses a company-internal package mirror), for a Package Ecosystem Provider (e.g. Debian), or a Language Ecosystem Provider (e.g. a company-internal CPAN mirror that distributes patched packages).

* Operates within a [Package Ecosystem](#package-ecosystem) or an [OSS Project Environment](#oss-project-environment).
* Within a package ecosystem, builds and creates packages from components received from an upstream source, optionally with patches applied from the [Patcher](#patcher).
* Within an author environment, creates packages from their own project in preparation for publication in a downstream [Language Ecosystem](#language-ecosystem) (e.g. create a CPAN package for uploading to CPAN using the PAUSE interface).
* Concerns themselves with correct package format and structure, and that package metadata is preserved and updated.

> * FIXME – Flesh out details

* Operates within a [Package Ecosystem](#package-ecosystem), creating containers.
* Builds, installs package dependencies and creates container images from a base images.

#### Curator

> [!NOTE]
> * Curators may decide both whether and where the output of a Packager is distributed.
> * Curators may operate both in-house, in order to keep an eye on what is being automatically installed there, or they may make the decisions that happen on the Package or Language Ecosystem Provider side.
> * Typically, a curator may consider LTS status, support contract terms or other reasons for distributing a package.

> [!CAUTION]
> * FIXME – Not done

* Operates within a [Package Ecosystem](#package-ecosystem) or a [Language Ecosystem](#language-ecosystem).
* Selects or pins which components are suitable for use downstream of the package ecosystem.
* Works mainly with the [Distributor](#distributor) role.
* Concerns themselves with both the stability and predictability of components, and how this is prioritized against the need for features, bug fixes and security updates.

(e.g. by setting up and managing a Debian APT repository, or a CPAN mirror, or a Docker container registry, or similar).
>     * If SBOM metadata is expected to accompany the packages or containers in question, the Provider makes sure this happens.

Operates within a [Package Ecosystem](#package-ecosystem) or a [Language Ecosystem](#language-ecosystem).
Ensures the availability of packages or containers, that they are indexed correctly, and that any related metadata is up-to-date, correct and available.

#### Developer

> [!CAUTION]
> * FIXME – Not done

* Equivalent to an [Integrator](#integrator)
    * (CPANSec) Avoid using this term, since it doesn't distinguish between developers who publish their work as Open Source ([Maintainer](#maintainer)), Developers who work on behalf of a [Manufacturer](#manufacturer), [Integrating](#integrator) components into some product, service or application, or a [Patcher](#patcher) working on behalf of a Package Ecosystem figuring out how to backport a fix.

#### Distributor

> [!CAUTION]
> * FIXME – Possible confusion between EU CRA's idea of a Distributor, and an OSS Package Distributor,

* Distributor is a term commonly used throughout Open Source Ecosystems, but
    * Distributors have additional requirements and considerations laid out in CISA-2024.
    * Distributors have additional requirements around compliance, laid out in the EU Cyber Resilience Act Article 20.

### Other common terms for Ecosystems and Roles

#### Repository Ecosystem

* See also
  * [Collaboration Ecosystem](#collaboration-ecosystem)

#### Author Environment

* See also
  * [OSS Project Environment](#oss-project-environment)

#### Manufacturer Environment

> [!NOTE]
> * FIXME – Much more to add!

  * [Integrator Environment](#integrator-environment)

#### Customer Environment

The environment and systems where a product or service is executed by a customer and thereby made available to their users.

* See also
  * [Production Environment](#production-environment)


#### Supplier

The Supplier is a term used throughout the Supply-chain, but most often represents a Role within a [Maintainer](#maintainer-environment) or an [Integrator](#integrator-environment) Environment.

* This term is used within the NTIA "SBOM Minimum Elements" document as the legal source of a component.
* (CPANSec) This term is confusing, as it doesn't distinguish between the different types of "Suppliers" that may be involved in the creation of a product.
    * Please use a more precise term, like [Author](#author), [Maintainer](#maintainer) or [Manufacturer](#manufacturer).

* See also

## Commentary and FIXMEs

1. Open Source in CRA... Maintainer -> Provider -> Supplier -> Steward -> Manufacturer -> Distributor
1. Open Source in CRA (simplified)... Hobbyist -> Maintainer -> Maintainer w/Steward -> Manufacturer
1. Add graph/description on build steps, to illustrate how different SBOM files may be found, sourced, generated, assembled, installed and shared for later verification or analysis.
1. Enumerate what distinguishes the different environments
    * Language: Not built, not deployed, Is source code, No execution environment
    * Distro/package: Built, Deployed, Is object code, No execution environment
    * Model/plugin: Built, Not deployed, Is data, No execution environment (FIXME – unsure)
    * Image/container: Built, Deployed, Is object code, Has execution environment
1. Enumerate the different dependencies
    * Stages; Author/develop, configure, build, test, install/deploy, packaging, container assembly, post-deploy (plugin/dynamic), runtime.
    * States; resolved, required/unresolved, embedded/included
    * Types; component, patch, system resource, environment, ecosystem, service
    * Descriptions; cross-ecosystem vs. in-ecosystem, up-river vs. down-river (within language ecosystem), upstream vs. downstream (outside language ecosystem), reverse, assumed/implied vs. stated/explicit, static vs. dynamic
1. Clearer distinction between Builder, Deployer, Packager, Assembler, Integrator
1. Add example of a chain of edits to an SBOM document, as it is passed down the supply-chain
1. Distinguish between Dependencies (as resolved by the Builder, Packager, Assembler or Integrator roles) and Requirements (unresolved, but as defined by the Author or Integrator roles).
1. Distinguish in which SBOM Types (or stages) different attributes are expected to be set, in order to help SBOM Authors produce and verify attributes as expected.
1. PCI-SSF v1.2.1 requires not only that component dependencies are listed, but also service dependencies ([download link](https://docs-prv.pcisecuritystandards.org/Software%20Security/Standard/PCI-Secure-Software-Standard-v1_2_1.pdf))
1. Use "Metadata" as the primary term, instead of "SBOM"
1. Add columns for attributes, describing downstream consumers and upstream producers
1. Add some text regarding an "Vulnerability report SBOM", since this is required in the Cyber Resilience Act Annex I, part II(1)
1. Make colors/boxes more colorblind-friendly
1. Describe the Supply Chain Roles section (intention, use, how to read, etc.), including why it has been split up into different roles
1. Add some words for each Role/section on what it can be used for
1. Add a Rosetta stone
1. Integrate better with the Glossary
