# CVE Submission Guide
This is a guide to submitting a CVE request to the CPAN Security CNA (CVE
Numbering Authority).

# Contacting the CNA
Send an email to cve-request@security.metacpan.org

# Reserving a CVE Identifier
If you have found a potential vulnerability in the scope of the CNA you can
request a CVE identifier.  

In most cases you will be asked to provide the details of the vulnerability
before a CVE identifier will be issued.  However, a CPAN author or Perl
Security may **reserve** a CVE number without providing details.  The CVE
identifier will be reserved and the requester will be recorded.

# Publishing a CVE
A previously reserved CVE identifier or a new CVE may be published.  To publish
a CVE the CNA requires the following minimal information:

1. The name of software that contains the vulnerability
2. The version or versions impacted
3. Description of the issue

Optionally you can also provide:

1. URLs that provide references or show the affected code
2. Potential mitigations of fixes
3. A JSON file generated by [Vulnogram](https://vulnogram.github.io/)

# Research the CVE database to ensure it has not been logged previously

Ensuring that the issue has not been previously logged is very important.
Duplicate entries will merely serve to confuse the issue and polute the CVE
database.

1. Access [Mitre.org CVE Search](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/search_cve_list.html)
1. Search for various keywords including but not limited to the distribution or
module name and any applicable words.
1. Review the results
1. If the CVE appears to be previously submmitted you can ask the CNA to decide
whether it is the same issue.

# Example data to provide

distribution.
