# CPAN Security Group (CPANSec)

Welcome to the [CPAN Security Group](https://security.metacpan.org/).
This is a community effort for supporting and responding to security incidents on CPAN ‚Äì the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network.

This group also cares about security-related topics around CPAN distributions, the CPAN/PAUSE infrastructure, and about tooling and the ecosystem in general.
Over time, we aim to improve supply chain security, make CPAN a more secure and trustworthy publishing platform, and more.
