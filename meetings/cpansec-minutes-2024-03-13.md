    - Review [reading list](https://security.metacpan.org/docs/readinglist.html) for details
3. [CPAN Provenance & Supply Chain Security](https://github.com/orgs/CPAN-Security/projects/3)

    - @stigtsp - Replied to brian d foy and github discussion around adding support for Perl
    - @sjn and @stigtsp have joined the OpenSSF slack. Invite was added to the IRC channel
5. [CPAN Security Patch Tooling](https://github.com/orgs/CPAN-Security/projects/11)
    - Discussion of the use of CVE id versus homegrown number.
    - @garu - expressed concern if the CVE numbers go away we would have a problem.
    - there is no reason we cannot have a local ID to be used (that was somewhat assumed previously - how to manage)
    - @timlegge (post meeting minute update) if I remember correctly we planned to primarily reference the CVE but did not discount the need for an internal identifier
    - Deferred to PTS discussion
6. [CPAN Software Composition Analysis](https://github.com/orgs/CPAN-Security/projects/6)
    - …
7. [CPAN Transparency Logs](https://github.com/orgs/CPAN-Security/projects/2)
    - @sjn - OpenSSF has quite a bit of info on this topic
8. [CPAN Vulnerability Index](https://github.com/orgs/CPAN-Security/projects/10)
    - @stigtsp - Public facing Vulnerability Index. - possibly chat at PTS
9. [CPANSec Governance, Policy & Funding](https://github.com/orgs/CPAN-Security/projects/7)
    - @sjn: German Sovereign Tech fund are [open for applications](https://www.sovereigntechfund.de/programs/applications). Minimum amount to apply for is €150k. Check out their [example application form](https://www.sovereigntechfund.de/public/files/stf_blank_application_form.pdf) to see what they need from us.
   - @oalders - what could be funded.  How to size - what would they fund?
   - @sjn - scope is pretty wide - 2FA for pause, TUF (eg), improving security anywhere in opensource.
   - Trying to schedule a meeting - what kind of things we could/should do and a rough order of magnitude of the work (time, dollars, etc)
   - @timlegge - to look for a time for a meeting next week

### Ongoing vulnerabilities

- HTTP::Body (marked fixed by mistake) - @stigtsp and Torsten Raudssus (@getty) discussed and a patch has been proposed
- Session Token Bug @stigtsp discussed with Leon Timmermans (@leont) in January - some issues when passed to C code
- Two ongoing items are under discussion in closed communication
- stigtsp and timlegge are working on the old vulnerabilities (as listed in CPAN::Audit) to have CVEs issued as required

### Operating changes

- @stigtsp – Matrix channel coordination / workload
- the triage should be coordinated to make sure that things are communicated.
- @stigtsp - possibly look at trying to break down by who is interested in certain areas.  A project meeting for those interested in law and policy for example.
- Meeting minutes are approved on github PR in the future.
