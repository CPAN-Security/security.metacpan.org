Here are a few items for something like a "List of principles when interacting with Open Source communities":

1. **Your digital infrastructure is in the commons** – The Open Source components, their ecosystems, and their communities which your business uses as a digital bedrock, are almost exclusively produced with volunteer effort.
This means that you _can_ contribute to improve your own infrastructure, under the license terms for each component project.

2. **There is no unified open source community** – while some parts of these communities are well-organized and resourced, these are found on the left side of the power law graph, and therefore disproportionately visible compared to the majority of communities.
Expect that the majority of your dependencies are found in the "long tail" part on the right of this graph, and your assumptions on how to interact needs to take this into account.

3. **Don't think only of your third party suppliers** – You do not have contracts with the Open Source communities you rely on, and they are not your suppliers.
Instead, reach out to them as if they are your "Unpaid Open Source Colleagues", or a "Second party partner" and treat them accordingly.
You have both a genuine interest in the correctness, resiliency and usefulness of the code, and therefore common goals to reach.

4. **Your open source bedrock is stabilized and supported by _you_** – You may be relying on thousands, if not tens of thousands of components and their maintainers; Interacting with all of them is unreasonable, if not impossible – therefore, we should look for and promote predictability, reliability and responsiveness in these communities.
This is to foster trust these communities to continue provide a safe and secure foundation for your business, while retaining the freedom to verify this, due to them operating under the terms of an open source license.
Though as with all foundations, they need a certain amount of care, attention and support.
Look for ways to strengthen not only the large and successful parts of your infrastructure, but also the smaller ones that may be resource-starved or crumbling.

5. **Open Source was never free** – The cost of creating and maintaining your infrastructure was never free.
The cost was always _externalized_, meaning that you benefited from other people's investments.
While assuming this will always be the case is reckless, there's no need to despair – the infrastructure is still maintained collaboratively. Your experiences and resources are still welcome, and is likely to offer cheaper and less risky solutions than what you gain from exchanging or rewriting your foundation and stack.
