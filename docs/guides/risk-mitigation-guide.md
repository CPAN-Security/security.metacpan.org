# Mitigating risk in the CPAN ecosystem

## For component projects published on CPAN

1. Consider availability for adoption when owner is unresponsive and distribution is made available for adoption via the [ADOPTME](https://metacpan.org/author/ADOPTME) facility on PAUSE/CPAN
2. Consider availability for assisting when owner is looking for co-maintainer support, via the [NEEDHELP](https://metacpan.org/author/NEEDHELP) facility on PAUSE/CPAN
3. Consider the availability for hand-off when owner is looking for someone to take over the distribution, via the [HANDOFF](https://metacpan.org/author/HANDOFF) facility on PAUSE/CPAN
4. Look for funding options for the projects in question
5. Update the required version for dependencies when included modules implement security fixes


## For CPAN ecosystems themselves, including PAUSE, MetaCPAN and any other supporting systems.

1. Fund ongoing security improvement work, via the Perl and Raku Foundation, or through the relevant projects themselves.
