# CPAN Security WG

This is an introduction!

Note:

Yay! We care about security on CPAN! :-D


[comment]: # (!!!)

## CPAN-SEC

* We care about **security on CPAN**!
* Made @Â **Perl Toolchain Summit** 2023 in Lyon, France

Note:

Established in April at the PTS 2023 in Lyon, France

I'm here to give you an introduction and a **call for participation**!

## What do we care about?

Note:

Here are some of the things we care about!


[comment]: # (|||)

### CPAN Vulnerability Index

ðŸ‘‰ **Auditing** and tracking vulnerabilities

Note:

Standardization and publishing of CPAN package vulnerabilities in relevant indexes (our own, or CVE or whatever). Also consider registering as a CNA (CVE Numbering Authority) 


[comment]: # (|||)

### CPAN Provenance & Supply Chain Security

ðŸ‘‰ Establishing a **trusted publishing infrastructure**

Note:

Establishing a trusted publishing infrastructure, including tooling and integration with in-toto.io and SLSA. 


[comment]: # (|||)

### CPAN Software Bills of Materials

ðŸ‘‰ **SBOM** creation and verification

Note:

Tooling for creating and managing standard SBOM objects like OWASP CycloneDX and SPDX, using existing CPAN metadata, with the purpose of supporting risk analysis and management


[comment]: # (|||)

### CPAN Transparency Logs

ðŸ‘‰ Tooling for **third-party monitoring** of&nbsp;package&nbsp;changes

Note:

Tooling for monitoring updates, but also integrity checking of metadata using tools like sigstore


[comment]: # (|||)

### CPAN Security Patch Tooling

ðŸ‘‰ Tooling for CPAN Distro security patches to enable **high-priority updates**

Note:

Develop tooling for publishing and applying third-party security patches to CPAN distributions that have non-responsive authors, to enable high-priority updates to CPAN packages.


[comment]: # (|||)

### CPAN Security Outreach & Information

ðŸ‘‰ Security and **incident communication** through relevant&nbsp;media&nbsp;channels

Note:

Keeping the different security information channels and documentation up-to-date and relevant info on incidents, best practices and usage documentation. Websites, social media and more.


[comment]: # (|||)

### And more!

* ðŸ‘‰ Software Composition Analysis
* ðŸ‘‰ CPAN-SEC Governance, Policy & Funding
* ðŸ‘‰ Rich Metadata & Dependencies
* ðŸ‘‰ Privacy and Compliance

Note:

* Tooling for analyzing dependencies for known vulnerabilities
* Working group rules, playbooks, governance, funding
* Improve interoperability with non-CPAN package indices
* Tracking legal and privacy issues around CPAN metadata, and compliance with GDPR, NIS2, and other regulations


[comment]: # (!!!)

## Why now?

* **Increased demands from upcoming laws** on supply chain security and metadata
    * US [EO 14028](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/) _Improving the Nationâ€™s Cybersecurity_
    * EU [NIS2 Directive](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis2-directive) &amp; [Cyber Resilience Act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/cyber-resilience-act)
* **Raise community awareness** on security topics
* CPAN is in the dependency trees of _many_ businesses, so it's high time we **get our ducks in&nbsp;a&nbsp;row**&nbsp;ðŸ¦†ðŸ¦†

Note:

* EO 14028
    * Executive Order on Improving the Nationâ€™s Cybersecurity
    * Issued May 12, 2021
