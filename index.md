Welcome to the [CPAN Security Group](https://security.metacpan.org/).
This is a community effort for supporting and responding to security incidents on CPAN ‚Äì the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network.

This group also cares about security-related topics around CPAN distributions, the CPAN/PAUSE infrastructure, and about tooling and the ecosystem in general.
Over time, we aim to improve supply chain security, make CPAN a more secure and trustworthy publishing platform, and more.

CPANSec is the [CVE Numbering Authority](/2025/02/25/cpansec-is-cna-for-perl-and-cpan.html) (CNA) for CPAN and Perl.

*[CNA]: CNA ‚Äì CVE Numbering Authority ‚Äì is an organization authorized to reserve and assign CVE numbers to vulnerabilities found within the organization's scope.
*[CVE]: CVE¬†‚Äì Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ‚Äì is the main record of publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities. This catalog is managed by the MITRE corporation for the benefit of the global cybersecurity community, and with help from many CNA organizations.
