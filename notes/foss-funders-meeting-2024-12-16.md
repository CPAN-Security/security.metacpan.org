FOSS Funders


## Claims & Quotes

1. _Contributions_ is the life-blood of Open Source projects.
2. Metrics is useful, but mainly for creating situation awareness.
  * By the time you learn an issue from a metric, it may be too late to address any root causes for the issue.
  * Situation awareness is useless if one fails to act on it in time.
3. This also goes for funding.
  * Do you offer funds only to successful projects (according to some metric),
  * …or also to projects where funding would make a major (reviving) difference?
  * If you fund a project, make sure it's one that you _use_, and that _needs_ it.
4. Funding is mainly a tool for making _Boring_ things happen.
  * Projects still need _competent_ people who _care_ enough to _contribute_.
  * Funding can help, but not without the right people caring enough about the right issues.

## _Boring Tasks_ require _Competent People_ who _Care_ enough to _Contribute_

1. The keyword we should focus on is _Boring_.
   * _Boring_ is _subjective_.
   * _Competent People_ who _Care_ can be found anywhere!
   * Let's make a list that allows people who have different interests and skills self-select where to contribute!
   * (And if _your_ business doesn't care, then no worries! This list isn't for you)
2. This is what we'd like to achieve in the CycloneDX Sustainability WG

## Questions

1. How can we ensure that sustainability information for projects is communicated to the right audience, and made use of in a constructive manner?
1. What other ways beyond funding and addressing needs can a business/OSPO help with
1. What signals does a business/OSPO expect to see before deciding to contribute?
